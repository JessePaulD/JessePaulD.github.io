		<p class="text1">The ‘Auf Montage’ event series at Hamburg's Golden Pudel Club not only utilises the small white cube to the right of the entrance, which once housed a drunk tank, but also the entire spatial structure of the club. In collaboration with the exhibiting artists, a new setting is created every month and the Pudel is given a different makeover. The goal is often the unprecedented. We see ourselves in particular as an exhibition venue for artists who are at the beginning of

		of their career, who are still studying, or who are experiencing stagnation on the rocky road of the scholarship and funding structure, or who feel little seen.

		We mediate between the art scene and enable certain groups of people to experience a different kind of art education, far removed from the museum. After all, the concept of art itself is constantly being called into question by its location in the famous club.</p>
